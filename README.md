# TFT_eSPI_ext
Extensions to the [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) library by bodmer


Font code mostly taken from ILI9341_t3 library by Paul Stoffregen,
then slightly optimized.

Note: At v 0.1.1 the API changed and this is no longer compatible with previous versions. The examples have been updated. Fonts can now be rendered to the screen or a sprite.
